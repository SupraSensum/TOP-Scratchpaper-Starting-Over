   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>
      Lasagna is a classic Italian comfort food made by layering wide sheets of pasta with rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel, and a blend of melted cheeses. Baked until bubbly and golden, it offers a perfect balance of savory, cheesy, and hearty flavors in every bite. The dish is traditionally made with beef or pork, though variations include vegetables or alternative proteins.
   </p>
   <p>
      Each layer soaks up flavor from the sauces, creating a melt-in-your-mouth texture that’s deeply satisfying. Often served at family gatherings and celebrations, lasagna is a timeless favorite that brings warmth and indulgence to the table.
